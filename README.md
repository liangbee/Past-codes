To use this piece of code, make sure the data in your matlabfiles are of the currect format. (binary neural data in appropriate dimensions)
and rename it as binary_trace_sequence.mat.

The output of this file will be in 4 matlabfiles. Though the clustergroup numbers might not come in order, they should suffice your purpose of clustering all the datapoints. Think of it as a name for that specific cluster rather than a specific order that carries any meaning.
